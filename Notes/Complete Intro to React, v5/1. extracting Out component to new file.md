# extracting Out component to new file :

```react
const Pet = ({ name, animal, breed }) => {
 return React.createElement("div", {}, [
  React.createElement("h1", {}, name),
  React.createElement("h2", {}, animal),
  React.createElement("h2", {}, breed)
 ]);
};
```

In VSCode we are targeting all this text and when yellow lightbulb is appearing click on it and press `Move to a new file`. Its going to create new file called `Pet.js` and insides will look like this:

```react
import React from "react";

export const Pet = ({ name, animal, breed }) => {
  return React.createElement("div", {}, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, name),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, animal),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, breed)
  ]);
};



```

 but its better to change Pet const to:

```react
import React from "react";

export default function Pet({ name, animal, breed }) {
  return React.createElement("div", {}, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, name),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, animal),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, breed)
  ]);
};

```

In the future its better to debug function like this.
